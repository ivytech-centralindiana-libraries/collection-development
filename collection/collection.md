## The Collection

### The Process of Collection Development
Collection development is a continuous process that consists of the selection of new materials and the weeding of materials that no longer raise the value of the collection. The entire collection should be reviewed, and weeded if necessary, once every five years at a minimum.

### Levels of Collection
Developed by the Research Libraries Group, the RLG Conspectus describes the depth of each collection level. The Ivy Tech Community College – Central Indiana Libraries collects at the Basic Information Level and the Instruction Support Level.

#### Basic Information Level:
At the basic information level, a collection’s purpose is to introduce and define a subject. The collection also leads to information available elsewhere. The material is general and up-to-date. Materials included:
*	Dictionaries and encyclopedias
*	Selected editions of important works
*	Historical surveys
*	Bibliographies
*	Handbooks
*	A limited collection of major periodicals
*	A small number of electronic materials

#### Instructional Support Level:
At the instructional support level, a collection is adequate to support undergraduate instruction. Independent study may also be sustained. The collection is not designed for research purposes, but to provide adequate knowledge of a subject for limited or generalized purposes. Materials included:
*	A wide range of basic monographs
*	A complete collections of works of more important writers
*	A selections from the works of secondary writers
*	A selection of representative journals
*	Reference tools and fundamental bibliographical materials

### Formats Collected 
The library strives to provide a diverse collection of materials that offer students support in their studies and offer instructors support in their instruction. Collecting both physical and electronic resources is part of this diversity. The library collects the following formats:
*	Books
*	Textbooks
*	Periodicals
*	Databases
*	Electronic Hardware & Software
*	DVDs

### Textbooks
All current textbooks are part of the Textbook Reserve collection. Special collection development policies and procedures for textbooks can be found under the Textbooks heading on page 7. 

### Liaisons
Librarians are assigned different areas of the collection. Each librarian is responsible for selecting materials and weeding materials in his or her specific area(s). The Librarians and the subject areas they are responsible for can be found here, on the Staff page of the Central Indiana Libraries' website.
